The United States has often been accused of exercising hegemony over other countries by exerting its economic and military strength. For example, during the Cold War era, the United States imposed economic sanctions on Cuba, Iran, and North Korea to isolate them from the global economy and limit their political influence. Similarly, the United States has maintained close military alliances with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Europe to project its power and influence in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
