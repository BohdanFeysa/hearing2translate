Bias measures the average difference between a model’s predictions and the true values, reflecting the model’s ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Variance measures the degree of fluctuation in a model’s predictions across different training datasets, reflecting the model’s sensitivity to noise in the training data.\n\nModels with high bias typically underfit the data, failing to accurately capture the patterns within the data, resulting in large prediction errors. Models with high variance typically overfit the data, being overly sensitive to the training data and performing poorly on unseen data.\n\nThe ideal model should strike a balance between bias and variance, accurately capturing the underlying patterns in the data while avoiding excessive sensitivity to noise. Techniques such as regularization and cross-validation can help us reduce overfitting, thereby lowering variance. Simultaneously, selecting more complex models or increasing the training data can help us reduce underfitting, thereby lowering bias.\n\nThe trade-off between bias and variance is a core concept that requires careful consideration in the model selection and optimization process."}
