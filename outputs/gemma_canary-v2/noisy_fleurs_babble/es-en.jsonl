Estos modelos se entrenan con enormes cantidades de datos paralelos, es decir, textos en dos idiomas que son traducciones uno del otro. \n\nEl proceso general implica la tokenización del texto de entrada (dividirlo en unidades más pequeñas como palabras o subpalabras), la codificación de estos tokens en representaciones numéricas (vectores), y luego la aplicación de un modelo para predecir la secuencia de tokens más probable en el idioma de destino. \n\nLas redes neuronales, en particular, han revolucionado el campo de la traducción automática, permitiendo la creación de modelos más complejos y precisos que los enfoques anteriores basados en reglas o en modelos estadísticos más simples. Arquitecturas como el Transformer, con su mecanismo de autoatención, han demostrado ser especialmente efectivas para capturar las dependencias de largo alcance en el texto, lo que resulta en traducciones más fluidas y naturales.\n\nSin embargo, la traducción automática todavía enfrenta desafíos significativos. La ambigüedad del lenguaje, la falta de datos paralelos para ciertos pares de idiomas, y la dificultad de traducir expresiones idiomáticas y culturales son obstáculos que limitan la calidad de las traducciones automáticas.
