Não se limita a verificar a correção gramatical ou a equivalência lexical, mas também considera a fluidez, a adequação ao contexto, a fidelidade ao sentido original e a capacidade de transmitir a intenção comunicativa do autor.\n\nA avaliação pode ser realizada de diversas formas: por especialistas em tradução, por falantes nativos da língua de destino, por utilizadores finais ou através de ferramentas automatizadas. Cada método apresenta vantagens e desvantagens, e a escolha da abordagem mais adequada depende do tipo de texto, do propósito da tradução e dos recursos disponíveis.\n\nAlém dos critérios intrínsecos à tradução, a avaliação da qualidade também deve levar em conta fatores externos, como as convenções culturais, as normas linguísticas e as expectativas do público-alvo. Uma tradução considerada perfeita em um contexto pode ser inadequada ou inaceitável em outro.\n\nÉ importante ressaltar que a avaliação da qualidade não tem como objetivo encontrar erros, mas sim identificar pontos fortes e fracos da tradução, a fim de promover a melhoria contínua do processo tradutório.\n\nAssessment of translation quality is a complex process involving multiple criteria and perspectives. It is not limited to verifying grammatical correctness or lexical equivalence, but also considers fluency, contextual appropriateness, fidelity to the original meaning, and the ability to convey the author’s communicative intent.\n\nThe assessment can be conducted in various ways: by translation specialists, by native speakers of the target language, by end-users, or through automated tools. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of the most appropriate approach depends on the type of text, the purpose of the translation, and the available resources.\n\nIn addition to the criteria intrinsic to translation, the assessment of quality should also take into account external factors, such as cultural conventions, linguistic norms, and the expectations of the target audience. A translation considered perfect in one context may be inappropriate or unacceptable in another.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the assessment of quality is not intended to find errors, but rather to identify strengths and weaknesses of the translation, in order to promote the continuous improvement of the translation process."}

A avaliação formativa, diferentemente da avaliação somativa, não visa atribuir uma nota ou classificação final, mas sim fornecer *feedback* contínuo e direcionado aos alunos, permitindo-lhes identificar os seus pontos fortes e fracos, e ajustar as suas estratégias de estudo.\n\nEste tipo de avaliação é particularmente útil em disciplinas que exigem a aplicação de conhecimentos e a resolução de problemas complexos, uma vez que possibilita aos alunos desenvolverem as suas competências de forma gradual e progressiva. Ao longo do processo de aprendizagem, o professor pode utilizar diversos instrumentos de avaliação formativa, como questionários, trabalhos em grupo, debates e autoavaliações, para monitorizar o progresso dos alunos e identificar as áreas que necessitam de maior atenção.\n\nA implementação eficaz da avaliação formativa requer, contudo, uma mudança de paradigma por parte dos professores, que devem passar de um papel de meros transmissores de informação para o de facilitadores da aprendizagem. Isto implica a adoção de práticas pedagógicas mais centradas no aluno, que promovam a sua autonomia e responsabilidade pelo seu próprio processo de aprendizagem.\n\nEm suma, a avaliação formativa é uma ferramenta poderosa para melhorar a qualidade do ensino e da aprendizagem, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento de alunos mais competentes, autónomos e motivados."}

Através da exploração de narrativas, personagens e temas diversos, a LIJ oferece oportunidades valiosas para que crianças e adolescentes desenvolvam a empatia, a resolução de problemas e a capacidade de compreender o mundo ao seu redor.\n\nNo entanto, a análise crítica da LIJ enfrenta desafios específicos. A complexidade da linguagem, a presença de elementos fantásticos e simbólicos, e a necessidade de considerar a perspectiva do público-alvo infantil exigem uma abordagem metodológica cuidadosa e interdisciplinar.\n\nEste capítulo visa fornecer um panorama geral das principais abordagens teóricas e metodológicas utilizadas na análise da LIJ, explorando as contribuições de autores e correntes de pensamento relevantes, como a psicanálise, o estruturalismo, o pós-estruturalismo e a teoria crítica. Serão discutidas questões fundamentais relacionadas à interpretação de textos, à identificação de padrões e temas recorrentes, e à avaliação do impacto da LIJ no desenvolvimento dos jovens leitores."}

Estes critérios podem ser agrupados em três categorias principais: a precisão, a fluidez e a adequação.\n\nA precisão refere-se à fidelidade da tradução ao texto original. Uma tradução precisa transmite o mesmo significado do texto original, sem adicionar ou omitir informação. No entanto, a precisão não é o único critério importante. Uma tradução pode ser precisa, mas ainda assim ser difícil de ler ou de compreender.\n\nA fluidez refere-se à facilidade com que a tradução pode ser lida e compreendida. Uma tradução fluida soa natural em inglês e não contém erros gramaticais ou sintáticos. A fluidez é importante porque uma tradução difícil de ler pode ser cansativa e desmotivadora para o leitor.\n\nA adequação refere-se ao grau em que a tradução é apropriada para o público-alvo e para o propósito da tradução. Uma tradução adequada utiliza a linguagem e o estilo corretos para o público-alvo e para o contexto da tradução. A adequação é importante porque uma tradução inadequada pode ser ofensiva ou incompreensível para o público-alvo.\n\nEm suma, a avaliação da qualidade da tradução deve levar em conta a precisão, a fluidez e a adequação. Uma boa tradução é aquela que é precisa, fluida e adequada para o público-alvo e para o propósito da tradução.\n\n\n\nTranslation quality assessment is a complex process that involves the analysis of several criteria. These criteria can be grouped into three main categories: accuracy, fluency, and adequacy.\n\nAccuracy refers to the fidelity of the translation to the original text. An accurate translation conveys the same meaning as the original text, without adding or omitting information. However, accuracy is not the only important criterion. A translation can be accurate but still difficult to read or understand.\n\nFluency refers to the ease with which the translation can be read and understood. A fluent translation sounds natural in English and contains no grammatical or syntactical errors. Fluency is important because a difficult-to-read translation can be tiring and demotivating for the reader.\n\nAdequacy refers to the degree to which the translation is appropriate for the target audience and the purpose of the translation. An adequate translation uses the correct language and style for the target audience and the context of the translation. Adequacy is important because an inadequate translation can be offensive or incomprehensible to the target audience.\n\nIn summary, translation quality assessment should take into account accuracy, fluency, and adequacy. A good translation is one that is accurate, fluent, and adequate for the target audience and the purpose of the translation."}

Este processo visa identificar e prever os efeitos que o projeto pode ter sobre o meio ambiente, buscando mitigar os impactos negativos e potencializar os benefícios.\n\nA elaboração de um Estudo de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) é uma etapa crucial nesse processo, envolvendo a coleta e análise de dados sobre a área de influência do projeto, a identificação de potenciais impactos e a proposição de medidas mitigadoras e compensatórias. O EIA deve ser elaborado por uma equipe multidisciplinar, com profissionais de diversas áreas do conhecimento, como biologia, geologia, sociologia e economia.\n\nAlém do EIA, é comum a realização de um Relatório de Impacto Ambiental (RIMA), que apresenta de forma clara e concisa os resultados do EIA, as medidas propostas e as alternativas consideradas. O RIMA é um documento público, acessível à população e utilizado como base para o processo de licenciamento ambiental.\n\nA participação pública é um elemento fundamental no processo de avaliação do impacto ambiental, garantindo que as preocupações e sugestões da comunidade sejam consideradas na tomada de decisões.

The EIS should be prepared by a multidisciplinary team, with professionals from diverse fields of knowledge, such as biology, geology, sociology, and economics.\n\nIn addition to the EIS, it is common to conduct an Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which presents in a clear and concise manner the results of the EIS, the proposed measures, and the alternatives considered. The EIR is a public document, accessible to the public, and used as a basis for the environmental licensing process.\n\nPublic participation is a fundamental element in the environmental impact assessment process, ensuring that community concerns and suggestions are considered in decision-making.

No entanto, apesar dos progressos notáveis, a tradução automática ainda enfrenta desafios consideráveis na produção de traduções precisas e fluidas, especialmente em contextos complexos e com nuances culturais.\n\nA qualidade de uma tradução automática depende de vários fatores, incluindo a arquitetura do modelo, a quantidade e a qualidade dos dados de treino utilizados, e a complexidade do par de línguas a ser traduzido. Os modelos de tradução automática podem ser amplamente classificados em três categorias principais: modelos baseados em regras, modelos estatísticos e modelos neurais.\n\nOs modelos baseados em regras utilizam um conjunto de regras gramaticais e lexicais predefinidas para traduzir o texto. Estes modelos são relativamente simples de implementar, mas podem ser inflexíveis e ter dificuldades em lidar com a ambiguidade e a variação linguística.\n\nOs modelos estatísticos utilizam técnicas estatísticas para aprender as probabilidades de diferentes traduções com base em grandes quantidades de texto bilingue. Estes modelos são mais flexíveis do que os modelos baseados em regras, mas podem ser computacionalmente dispendiosos e requerem grandes quantidades de dados de treino.\n\nOs modelos neurais, por outro lado, utilizam redes neurais artificiais para aprender a traduzir o texto. Estes modelos têm demonstrado um desempenho superior em comparação com os modelos baseados em regras e estatísticos, especialmente em tarefas de tradução complexas. No entanto, os modelos neurais podem ser difíceis de treinar e interpretar, e podem ser propensos a erros de tradução.\n\nAutomatic machine translation has rapidly evolved over the last few decades, driven by significant advances in areas such as natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML). However, despite notable progress, automatic machine translation still faces considerable challenges in producing accurate and fluent translations, especially in complex contexts with cultural nuances.\n\nThe quality of an automatic translation depends on several factors, including the model architecture, the quantity and quality of the training data used, and the complexity of the language pair being translated. Automatic machine translation models can be broadly classified into three main categories: rule-based models, statistical models, and neural models.\n\nRule-based models utilize a set of predefined grammatical and lexical rules to translate text. These models are relatively simple to implement, but can be inflexible and struggle to handle ambiguity and linguistic variation.\n\nStatistical models use statistical techniques to learn the probabilities of different translations based on large amounts of bilingual text. These models are more flexible than rule-based models, but can be computationally expensive and require large quantities of training data.\n\nNeural models, on the other hand, use artificial neural networks to learn to translate text. These models have demonstrated superior performance compared to rule-based and statistical models, especially in complex translation tasks. However, neural models can be difficult to train and interpret, and may be prone to translation errors."}

A urbanização, entendida como o processo de crescimento das cidades e a concentração da população em áreas urbanas, tem impactos complexos e multifacetados na saúde das pessoas.\n\nHistoricamente, a urbanização tem sido associada a melhorias no acesso a serviços de saúde, educação e saneamento básico, fatores que contribuem para o aumento da esperança de vida e a redução da mortalidade infantil. No entanto, a urbanização descontrolada e a falta de planejamento urbano adequado podem levar a uma série de problemas de saúde pública, como a poluição do ar e da água, a disseminação de doenças infecciosas, o aumento da violência e a desigualdade social.\n\nAlém disso, a urbanização pode exacerbar fatores de risco para a saúde, como o sedentarismo, a má alimentação e o estresse, contribuindo para o aumento da prevalência de doenças crônicas não transmissíveis, como doenças cardiovasculares, diabetes e obesidade. A densidade populacional elevada, a falta de espaços verdes e a exposição a ruído excessivo também podem ter efeitos negativos na saúde mental e no bem-estar das pessoas.\n\nPortanto, é fundamental que as políticas públicas de saúde considerem as particularidades do contexto urbano e busquem soluções inovadoras para mitigar os impactos negativos da urbanização na saúde pública, promovendo a criação de cidades mais resilientes, equitativas e saudáveis para todos.\n\nThe analysis of the relationship between urbanization and public health is crucial for the formulation of effective policies and for the promotion of healthier urban environments.

However, uncontrolled urbanization and a lack of adequate urban planning can lead to a series of public health problems, such as air and water pollution, the spread of infectious diseases, increased violence, and social inequality.\n\nFurthermore, urbanization can exacerbate risk factors for health, such as sedentary lifestyles, poor nutrition, and stress, contributing to the increased prevalence of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity. High population density, a lack of green spaces, and exposure to excessive noise can also have negative effects on mental health and people’s well-being.\n\nTherefore, public health policies must consider the particularities of the urban context and seek innovative solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on public health, promoting the creation of more resilient, equitable, and healthy cities for all."}

Um texto adequado deve ser compreensível para o público-alvo, relevante para o contexto e eficaz para atingir o propósito comunicativo pretendido.\n\nA correção, por sua vez, diz respeito à precisão linguística da tradução.

Em termos matemáticos, o objetivo é minimizar a seguinte função:\n\nΣ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²\n\nOnde:\n\n*   yᵢ são os valores observados da variável dependente.\n*   ŷᵢ são os valores previstos da variável dependente (calculados como ŷᵢ = β₀ + β₁xᵢ).\n\nUma vez estimados os coeficientes, é possível calcular o coeficiente de determinação (R²), que indica a proporção da variação na variável dependente que é explicada pela variável independente. Um R² próximo de 1 indica um bom ajuste do modelo aos dados, enquanto um R² próximo de 0 indica um ajuste pobre.\n\nAlém disso, é importante avaliar os resíduos (a diferença entre os valores observados e os valores previstos) para verificar se as suposições da regressão linear simples são satisfeitas, como a normalidade e a homocedasticidade.\n\nSimple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method for examining the relationship between two variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable. The primary objective is to model the linear relationship between them, allowing for the prediction of the dependent variable's value based on the independent variable's value.\n\nSimple linear regression assumes that the relationship between the variables can be represented by a straight line. This line is defined by a linear equation of the form:\n\ny = β₀ + β₁x + ε\n\nWhere:\n\n*   y is the dependent variable.\n*   x is the independent variable.\n*   β₀ is the intercept (the value of y when x is equal to zero).\n*   β₁ is the regression coefficient (the slope of the line, representing the change in y for each unit change in x).\n*   ε is the random error (represents the variation in y that is not explained by the linear relationship).\n\nThe method of least squares is generally used to estimate the values of β₀ and β₁ that minimize the sum of squared errors. In mathematical terms, the objective is to minimize the following function:\n\nΣ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²\n\nWhere:\n\n*   yᵢ are the observed values of the dependent variable.\n*   ŷᵢ are the predicted values of the dependent variable (calculated as ŷᵢ = β₀ + β₁xᵢ).\n\nOnce the coefficients are estimated, it is possible to calculate the coefficient of determination (R²), which indicates the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. An R² close to 1 indicates a good fit of the model to the data, while an R² close to 0 indicates a poor fit.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to evaluate the residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values) to verify whether the assumptions of simple linear regression are met, such as normality and heteroscedasticity."}

Não se trata apenas de verificar a correção gramatical e lexical, mas também de analisar a adequação do texto traduzido ao contexto de receção, a sua fluidez, naturalidade e a sua capacidade de transmitir a intenção comunicativa do texto original.\n\nA avaliação pode ser realizada por diferentes agentes: tradutores, revisores, clientes, utilizadores finais ou especialistas em determinados domínios. Cada um destes agentes pode ter critérios de avaliação distintos, dependendo dos seus objetivos e conhecimentos.\n\nExistem diferentes métodos de avaliação da tradução, desde os mais subjetivos, baseados na intuição e experiência do avaliador, até os mais objetivos, que recorrem a indicadores quantitativos, como a taxa de erros ou a frequência de determinados termos. No entanto, a maioria dos métodos de avaliação combina elementos subjetivos e objetivos, reconhecendo que a qualidade da tradução é um conceito multidimensional.\n\nÉ importante considerar que a qualidade da tradução não é um atributo intrínseco do texto traduzido, mas sim uma relação entre o texto original, o texto traduzido e o contexto de receção. Uma tradução que é considerada de alta qualidade num determinado contexto pode não ser adequada noutro.\n\nPor fim, a avaliação da qualidade da tradução deve ser vista como um processo contínuo, que visa identificar pontos fortes e fracos na tradução e contribuir para a melhoria da prática tradutória.\n\n\n\nTranslation quality assessment is a complex process involving multiple criteria and perspectives. It is not merely about verifying grammatical and lexical accuracy, but also about analyzing the suitability of the translated text to the reception context, its fluency, naturalness, and its ability to convey the communicative intent of the original text.\n\nAssessment can be carried out by different agents: translators, revisers, clients, end users, or specialists in specific domains. Each of these agents may have distinct assessment criteria, depending on their objectives and knowledge.\n\nThere are different methods for assessing translation, ranging from the most subjective, based on the assessor's intuition and experience, to the most objective, which rely on quantitative indicators, such as the error rate or the frequency of specific terms. However, most assessment methods combine subjective and objective elements, recognizing that translation quality is a multidimensional concept.\n\nIt is important to consider that the quality of translation is not an intrinsic attribute of the translated text, but rather a relationship between the original text, the translated text, and the reception context. A translation that is considered high quality in one context may not be suitable in another.\n\nFinally, translation quality assessment should be viewed as a continuous process, aiming to identify strengths and weaknesses in the translation and contribute to the improvement of translation practice."}

Esses fatores moldam a forma como as pessoas interpretam informações sobre riscos ambientais, suas preocupações e suas ações.\n\nDiversas teorias tentam explicar os processos cognitivos e emocionais envolvidos na percepção de risco. A Teoria do Prospecto, por exemplo, sugere que as pessoas tendem a ser mais sensíveis às perdas do que aos ganhos, o que pode levar a reações exageradas diante de riscos ambientais percebidos. A heurística da disponibilidade, por outro lado, indica que as pessoas estimam a probabilidade de um evento com base na facilidade com que exemplos desse evento vêm à mente, o que pode distorcer a avaliação de riscos raros, mas potencialmente graves.\n\nAlém das teorias cognitivas, a pesquisa em percepção de risco ambiental também considera o papel das normas sociais, dos valores pessoais e das crenças sobre a natureza e a tecnologia. As normas sociais, por exemplo, podem influenciar as ações das pessoas ao sinalizar o que é considerado um comportamento aceitável ou inaceitável em relação a questões ambientais. Os valores pessoais, como a preocupação com a saúde, o bem-estar das futuras gerações ou a preservação da biodiversidade, podem motivar as pessoas a adotar práticas mais sustentáveis.\n\nA compreensão da percepção de risco ambiental é crucial para o desenvolvimento de políticas e estratégias eficazes de gestão ambiental. Ao reconhecer os fatores que influenciam a avaliação e a resposta a riscos ambientais, é possível criar mensagens e intervenções que promovam a conscientização, a mudança de comportamento e a participação pública na tomada de decisões.\n\nAn analysis of environmental risk perception is a multidisciplinary field of study that aims to understand how individuals, groups, and organizations assess and respond to potential threats to the environment.\n\nRisk perception is not simply an objective evaluation of the probability and magnitude of a hazard, but rather a subjective process influenced by psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors. These factors shape how people interpret information about environmental risks, their concerns, and their actions.\n\nVarious theories attempt to explain the cognitive and emotional processes involved in risk perception. Prospect Theory, for example, suggests that people tend to be more sensitive to losses than to gains, which can lead to exaggerated reactions to perceived environmental risks. The availability heuristic, on the other hand, indicates that people estimate the probability of an event based on how easily examples of that event come to mind, which can distort the assessment of rare, but potentially serious, risks.\n\nIn addition to cognitive theories, research on environmental risk perception also considers the role of social norms, personal values, and beliefs about nature and technology. Social norms, for example, can influence people’s actions by signaling what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior regarding environmental issues. Personal values, such as concern for health, the well-being of future generations, or the preservation of biodiversity, can motivate people to adopt more sustainable practices.\n\nUnderstanding environmental risk perception is crucial for the development of effective environmental management policies and strategies. By recognizing the factors that influence the assessment and response to environmental risks, it is possible to create messages and interventions that promote awareness, behavioral change, and public participation in decision-making."}
